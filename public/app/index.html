            Do you wanna know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You can't
            savor all the... little emotions. You see, in their last moments,
            people show you who they really are. So in a way, I knew your
            friends better than you ever did. Would you like to know which of
            them were cowards? <br /><br />
            And why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.
            <br /><br />
            Well these conversation used to end with an unusual request. Well,
            let me show you some stuff, anyway. Just for old times' sake.
            <br /><br />
            Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.
            <br /><br />
            You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become
            the villain.
            <br /><br />
            I think you and your friend have found the last game in town. where
            it hurts, their wallets. It's bold. You gonna count me in?
            <br /><br />
            I just the took to calling it the Bat. And yes Mr. Wayne, it does
            come in black.
            <br /><br />
            Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to
            take them on one at a time ?
            <br /><br />
            It doesn't matter who we are. What matters is our plan.
            <br /><br />
            Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.
            <br /><br />
            I had a vision of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a
            little profit and the police tried to shut them down one block at a
            time. And it was so boring. I've had a change of heart. I don't want
            Mr Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun?
            Let's give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn't dead in 60
            minutes then I blow up a hospital.
            <br /><br />
            Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated. But
            we are initiated aren't we, Bruce? Members of the League of Shadows.
            And you betrayed us.
            <br /><br />
            But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger
            strangIing the grief until the memory of your loved one is just
            poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the
            person you loved had never existed so you'd be spared your pain.
            <br /><br />
            You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful,
            like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to
            smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One
            day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She
            can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to
            know that I don't care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And
            you know what? She can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I
            see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling.
