          Do you wanna know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You can't
          savor all the... little emotions. You see, in their last moments,
          people show you who they really are. So in a way, I knew your friends
          better than you ever did. Would you like to know which of them were
          cowards? <br /><br />
          And why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.
          <br /><br />
          Well these conversation used to end with an unusual request. Well, let
          me show you some stuff, anyway. Just for old times' sake.
          <br /><br />
          Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.
          <br /><br />
          You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become
          the villain.
          <br /><br />
          I think you and your friend have found the last game in town. where it
          hurts, their wallets. It's bold. You gonna count me in?
          <br /><br />
          I just the took to calling it the Bat. And yes Mr. Wayne, it does come
          in black.
          <br /><br />
          Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to
          take them on one at a time ?
          <br /><br />
          It doesn't matter who we are. What matters is our plan.
          <br /><br />
          Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.
          <br /><br />
          I had a vision of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a little
          profit and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time. And
          it was so boring. I've had a change of heart. I don't want Mr Reese
          spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun? Let's give
          someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn't dead in 60 minutes then
          I blow up a hospital.
          <br /><br />
          Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated. But
          we are initiated aren't we, Bruce? Members of the League of Shadows.
          And you betrayed us.
          <br /><br />
          But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangIing
          the grief until the memory of your loved one is just poison in your
          veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved
          had never existed so you'd be spared your pain.
          <br /><br />
          You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful,
          like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile
          more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they
          carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it.
          I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don't
          care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She
          can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now
          I'm always smiling.
